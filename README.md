# Proton-Mail-Linux-arm64
This repo is a mirror of official proton mail desktop app hosted in: https://github.com/ProtonMail/inbox-desktop 

I am offering the Linux arm64 rpm version of the app so distros like Fedora Asahi Remix and others are able to use the app until proton team release arm64 version for linux out of the box.
